Setup Atom 
Debian Linux (Ubuntu)

Atom is only available for 64-bit Linux systems.

1. Download atom-amd64.deb from the Atom releases page.
2. Run sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb on the downloaded package.
3. Launch Atom using the installed atom command.

The Linux version does not currently automatically update so you will need to repeat these steps to upgrade to future releases.
